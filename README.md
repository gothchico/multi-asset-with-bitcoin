### Project Details:
**Project Title:**  Digital Gold (Bitcoin) vs Gold: A Risk Budgeting Approach to Sizing Portfolio Diversifiers \
**Description:** The dialogue around Bitcoin has been growing exponentially with the potential creation of the Strategic
Bitcoin Reserve proposed by the incoming administration. With its relative new place as a legitimately
traded product, it is important to quantitatively identify what role bitcoin is actually playing in a traditional
asset allocation mix and how to size such an investment. This project aims to identify Bitcoin's diversifiability within a portfolio.\
